# Distributed-Image-Processing-System

Develop a distributed image processing system that allows users to upload images for various transformations (e.g., resizing, filtering, object detection). The system would leverage C++ for high-performance image processing algorithms and use Kubernetes to manage and scale the microservices architecture.
